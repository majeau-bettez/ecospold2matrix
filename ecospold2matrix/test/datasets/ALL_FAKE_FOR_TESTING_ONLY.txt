Files in this folder may look like official ecoinvent files at first sight, but
it's all fake! For testing only.


All flows are fictional, with random amounts, producing an unrealistic economy
with three inter-dependent processes. All comments have been replaced by "lorem
ipsum...".

Filenames include the word "fake" to distinguish them from the true ecospold
files

The idea is to unit-test the parser, and therefore use a file format as close
as possible to the original one, with true UUID and names, but all the rest is
removed or replaced to avoid copyright complications.

The master xml files have also been truncated to cover only the three processes
of interest and two emissions.
